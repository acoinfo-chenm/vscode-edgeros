sss
This Extension includes tools for EdgerOS developers to **build**, **install** and **update** EdgerOS applications on your EdgerOS devices. The extension can also validate your edgeros.json before deployment and monitor app execution status on your device.


## Features

### Create a project

You can create an EdgerOS sample project from our built-in templates.  
Note: due to [Github rate limit](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/rate-limits-for-github-apps), **it might fail when retrieve remote templates**.
